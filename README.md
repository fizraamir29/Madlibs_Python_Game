# Madlibs_Python_Game
Welcome to the Mad Libs Python Project! This project allows you to create and play Mad Libs, a fun and interactive word game where players fill in the blanks to complete a story.
Mad Libs is a popular word game where players are prompted to provide various types of words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) which are then used to fill in the blanks in a pre-written story template. The result is often a humorous and nonsensical story
